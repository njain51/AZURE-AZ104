# Azure Alerts

- Azure Alerts can be created to let you or others know that something is amiss within your Azure infrastructure.
- Azure Alerts can be triggered from several signal types, 
  - including metrics - such as performance counters, 
  - events - storage logs, 
  - the status - resource health, 
  - notifications - log search queries
- The signal types would then trigger an alert within Azure Monitor.
- The alert is then sent to an action group.
- In the action group has a list of receivers 
  - sending an email 
  - or SMS, phone,
  - or voice, 
  - Logic app
  - or an Azure function.
