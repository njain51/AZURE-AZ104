  - No, Yes, No
  -Users in this role (Cloud device admin) can enable, disable, and delete devices in Azure AD and read Windows 10 BitLocker keys (if present) in the Azure portal. The role does not grant permissions to manage any other properties on the device. User1 is not a group owner so NO
  - User2 owns Group1, so they can add a device manually = YES
  -  User2 owns Group2, however this is a dynamic group and the group rules must match device2. As such, the device cannot be added manually = NO (the option does not mention User2 modifying the group rules).
```text
Owner of all groups - User2

User1 can add Device2 to Group1 - No
User2 can add Device1 to Group1 - Yes
User2 can add Device2 to Group2 - No


Owner of groups - User1 (Group1) & User2 (Group2)
User1 can add Device2 to Group1 - Yes
User2 can add Device1 to Group1 - Yes
User2 can add Device2 to Group2 - No
