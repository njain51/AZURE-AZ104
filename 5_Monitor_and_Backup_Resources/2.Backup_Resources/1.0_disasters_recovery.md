## Disasters

- Natural Disasters 
- Other disaster could occur because of a hardware failure, cyber attacks are on the rise, and let's not forget human errors.
  - November 6 in 2017, Level 3 had an outage that brought down Comcast Internet in the US
  - 

## Azure Traffic Manager
- Manages traffic from different regions and redirects traffic to one where resources are available. Traffic will be directed to unaffected regions 
- this is all handled at the fabric layer, you don't have to do any of this.

### Different protection options:  
- SQL databases - Microsoft ensures that you had three copies of the backup in the same region at all times.
- availability sets for virtual machines: This is not specifically handled by Microsoft, but is something that you can leverage within the platform to protect your virtual machines.
- Azure Cosmos DB - has automatic backups that are replicated to another region.
- MySQL and PostgresSQL, both have automatic backups as well.


### disaster recovery plan

**- Planning - should be fully docuemnted** 
- **Testing** - should be fully tested
- Resources should be available in other locations - hot, warm, or cold sites
- **RTO**: Recovery time objective, RTO, is a duration or length of time that a business must be functional after a disaster
- **RPO**: Recovery Point Objective - RPO is the maximum amount of data that can be lost after a disaster
- if RTO and RPO is minimum then cost will be maximum
