# Azure AD Join

- Users want to be able to work from anywhere, on any device, at any time. To allow them to do that, we can use Azure Active Directory.
- **once device is joined then we can manage as per company policy**
- There are three types of **device management options.** 
  - A device can be **registered**, 
  - **join**, 
  - or in a hybrid Azure scenario, we can use a **hybrid Azure Active Directory join**.

## Device Registration
- register device to azure AD
- identity is assigned to device
- authenticate device to azure AD
- enable or disable the device
- combine with mobile device management for conditional access


## Device Join
- extension of registering the device
- change the state of device:
  - users sign in with org account or school account. No personal account
- Windows 10 only
- Benefits: 
  - single sign-on
  - restrict access
  - state roaming
  - windows hello
  - microsoft store for biz access

## Hybrid Azure AD

- used when devices are joined with AD on premises
- win 7 or later
