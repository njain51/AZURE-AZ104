# Password reset

- we can enable it for all users or selected groups
- administrator is not in the list for password reset because by default 2FA is required by admins for password reset
- at authentication methods we can select 1 or 2 methods like email, security questions( predefined or custom) for pass reset
- registration option helps with number of days for users to reconfirm their auth. Change to 0 if you dont want this to reconfirm.
- if you're using Azure Active Directory Connect to synchronize on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory, you can enable right back passwords to your on-premises directory and allow users to unlock accounts without resetting their passwords
