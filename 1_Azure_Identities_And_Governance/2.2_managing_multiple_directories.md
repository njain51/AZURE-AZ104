# Managing Multiple Directories;

- All Azure AD are independent of each other
- An Azure AD must be associated with subscription
- we can have multiple Azure AD - lets say for each environment like Dev. prod etc.
- a domain name can only be sued by single Azure AD
- creator of tenant is a global admin for azure AD
- other Administrator dont have global permissioon to this AD by default unless assigned 
- even if subscription is deleted then still Azure AD won't be deleted
- Azure AD would still be accesible through powershell, office 365, microsoft graph API etc.
- To delete an Azure Active Directory , we must first delete following
  - all AD users
  - all AD app
  - disable MFA
  - remove all other microsoft online subscription
  - only one global admin is left who can delete Azure AD

- Once above prereuistes are met, we switch to that azure ad and then delete it.
